Introduction
In a client-server model, clients are devices or software applications that request and receive services from a server, while servers are systems that provide these services. Clients initiate requests, and servers process them, returning the requested information or performing the requested action. 
 Client :
A client is a computer hardware device or software that accesses a service made available by a server. The server is often (but not always) located on a separate physical computer.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Clients:
Initiate requests:
Clients, like web browsers or email applications, send requests to servers for data or services. 
Receive responses:
After sending a request, the client waits for a response from the server and then processes or displays the information. 
Examples:
Web browsers (like Chrome or Firefox), email clients (like Outlook or Thunderbird), and mobile apps are all examples of clients.


Servers:
A server is a physical computer dedicated to run services to serve the needs of other computers. Depending on the service that is running, it could be a file server, database server, home media server, print server, or web server.
What is the difference between server and client?
Simply, client services request to the server where server services respond to the client after the server checks data from the data store.

Provide services:
Servers are responsible for providing various services to clients, such as storing files, running applications, managing databases, or delivering web pages.
Process requests:
Servers receive and process requests from clients, returning the requested information or performing the requested actions.
Examples:
Web servers, database servers, file servers, and mail servers are all examples of servers. 
In essence, the internet and client-server model work by having clients connect to servers to access resources and services. 



Your web browser is an example of a web client .A client and server communicate using a special language (a protocol)is called HTTP.














IP Addresses and Domain Name
Understanding The Differences: Domain, URL, and IP
Domains, URLs, and IP addresses, each play a unique role in the digital ecosystem. Understanding the differences between these components is crucial for anyone looking to grasp how the web operates. This article aims to demystify these concepts by explaining what a domain, a URL, and an IP address are, and why DNS resolvers are essential in translating fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) into IP addresses, while not functioning with URLs and IP addresses directly.
 Domain:
A domain is a human-readable address used to identify a location on the internet. Domains consist of a series of characters (letters and numbers) and are structured in levels, separated by dots. For example:
Top-Level Domain (TLD): .com, .org, .net
Second-Level Domain (SLD): example in example.com
Subdomain: www in www.example.com
A full domain name might look like www.example.com.
 URL:
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a complete address used to access a specific resource on the internet. It includes several components:
Scheme: http:// or https://
Domain: www.example.com
Path: /page
Port: :8080 (optional)
Query String: ?id=123 (optional)
Fragment: #section1 (optional)
Example of a URL: https://www.example.com/page?id=123#section1
What is an IP Address?
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses come in two versions:
IPv4: 192.168.1.1
IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
Why DNS Resolvers Use Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs)
What is a DNS Resolver
A DNS resolver is a server on the internet that translates domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1). This process is essential because while humans use domain names to navigate the web, computers use IP addresses to communicate.
Why DNS Resolvers Use FQDNs and Not URLs or IPs:
FQDNs vs. URLs:
FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) includes the complete domain hierarchy: subdomain.domain.tld (e.g., www.example.com).
URLs are more complex and include additional elements (scheme, path, query string) that are not relevant to the DNS resolution process.
DNS resolvers are designed to handle the domain part of the URL only, not the entire URL structure. The resolverâ€™s job is to map the FQDN to an IP address, not to interpret paths, ports, or protocols.
FQDNs vs. IPs:
IP Addresses are already the end result of DNS resolution. DNS resolvers are unnecessary when you have an IP address because the translation step (domain to IP) is not required.
DNS resolvers function to convert FQDNs into IP addresses for routing purposes. If you already have an IP address, the role of the DNS resolver is bypassed.
Summary
Domain: A human-readable name for a location on the internet.
URL: A complete address for accessing a specific resource on the internet.
IP Address: A numerical label used by computers to identify each other on the network.
DNS Resolver: Translates FQDNs into IP addresses, essential for navigating the web.
DNS resolvers need FQDNs because their primary function is to map these names to IP addresses. URLs contain extraneous information not relevant to this 
process, and IP addresses do not need resolution.
